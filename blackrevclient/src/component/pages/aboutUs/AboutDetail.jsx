<h5>WHAT WE STAND FOR</h5>

      <Card.Body>
We are committed to seeking a far-reaching and deep-rooted turnaround of Nigeria and indeed Africa. We opine that the kind of government we have in Nigeria is a reflection of the people of Nigeria, and the socio-political and economic situation is a product of the nature of the society and people of Nigeria. There is no denying the fact that our society is sick. And, it is this sick society that produces sick leaders and consequently bad governance. The ailment is in our moral compass as a people, which has long been lost. Some of the sicknesses include but not limited to mental laziness, misplaced priorities, socio-political short-sightedness, socio-political ethics, and orientation, shared selfishness and greed, indolence and yet desperation to get rich by cutting corners, values and ethos, blind sentiments of ethnicity, tribe, and religion, all these and many more, are the bane of our nation. Rather than providing the required leadership that can herald the way for the renaissance of the people, our leaders merely capitalize on the rots amongst the Nigerian people to further exploit us for their own selfish political gains. They acquire money to the detriment of society. This is the reason why there is no sanity and discipline in our public life.

Unfortunately, rather than for the electorate to make the leaders accountable especially during elections, they ask them for paltry sums of money, a pouch of onions and rice in exchange for our votes, mortgaging our lives, future, and that of our unborn generation for two liters of vegetable oil, 5kg of rice and sometimes sum as small as three thousand naira or less.

We have long lost our sense of honor, valor, and heroism, and all the values that a society should have that culminate in a great nation. Certainly, indiscipline and lawlessness are recipes for disaster in any sane society, but in Nigeria, it is the order in our society and public life. For so long as Nigerians remain like this, no political party, politician, or leader from anywhere be it Mars or Jupiter, can perform any magic to salvage our situation.

We need a culture of leadership where true leaders and not rulers are raised. Such leaders will have the mission and responsibility to fix Nigeria for the advancement of the country. We are posed to galvanize and train Nigerians for this mission so that they will be ready to lead well-cultured followers for a prosperous and egalitarian Nigeria and the same for Africa.

     <h5>WHY THE BLACKMAN'S REVOLUTION</h5>
    </Accordion.Toggle>
    <Accordion.Collapse eventKey="1">
      <Card.Body>Nigeria as well as many African countries is comatose and very close to becoming failed states. If we look away and do nothing as our country slide down the slope of catastrophe, we are sure of the complete collapse of the country. Indeed urgency is required to save the situation. Reformation by its nature is a gradual process which will not meet the urgency that our situation requires. That is to say, that reformation is a gradual and incremental process of modification but which does not alter the society fundamentally.

On the other hand, revolution requires a faster and dramatic turnaround and far-reaching transformation of society. The solution to Nigeria’s and Africa’s problem requires such a drastic reformation. Hence The Blackman's Revolution.</Card.Body>

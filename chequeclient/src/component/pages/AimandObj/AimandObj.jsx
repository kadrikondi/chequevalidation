   <li> We must work on our sense of patriotism towards our nation </li>

   <li> We must work on our mental laziness and indifference that debar us from digging deep and following facts and intellectual details of public life.</li>
    <li>We must work on our sense of priority that makes us value fun, entertainment, luxury, and pass-time over hard work, deep and strategic thinking, reading, research, and life-long learning.</li>
     <li>We must work on our moral compass that has gone so bad that we live our lives and take actions that are inimical to the overall well-being of society.</li>
   <li> We must work on our sense of materialism and get-rich-quick syndrome.</li>
    <li> We must work on our greed that makes us pursue money at the expense of others and to the detriment of our country.</li>
    <li>  We must work on our attitude of haste, indiscipline, and impatience in almost everything.</li>
     <li>We must work on our political awareness and attitude that make us either indifferent or sell votes for money.</li> 

    <li>We must work on our political orientation that makes us support candidates based on their money, religion, and ethnic bias.</li> 
    <li> We must work on our attitude and disposition towards the moral upbringing of our children.</li>
      <li>We must work on our social consciousness and conscience, our value system, mindset, norms, and moors.</li> 
    <li> We must work on our dismal fear and cowardice that make it easy for politicians to coerce us to do the wrong thing.</li>

    <li> We must work on our penchant to give, take or demand bribes. The same goes for our addiction to fraud, shortcuts, nepotism, and other sharp practices.</li>
      <li>  We must work on our dismally poor level of creativity and productivity.</li>

OBJECTIVES </h5> <br/>  

The aims of the required social revolution have been enumerated above, but the list is not in any way exhaustive, for whatever we are found doing as a people that is inimical to the progress and wellbeing of our nation must be worked on. However, these are not going to be an easy task for the following reasons;  <br/>  <br/>
<ul>
    <li>
    It is not easy for a human being to change his/her ways of life; mentality, habits, and common practices. </li> 
     <li> If the above can be said to be difficult for an individual, then it seems almost an impossible task to call for the entire society to change. </li>
     <li>People cannot begin to change unless they are mentally convinced on the need to, and feel socially secured to act in the right direction, for if there is any iota of fear that they are alone in that regard and that the usual way still remains the norm for others, they will not want to discipline themselves and be at a disadvantage for the next-door neighbor who will exploit his own discipline. </li>  
   <li> Social revolution must be far-reaching and widespread, and thus requires a highly rigorous, resilient, and mountainous effort to spread the message far and wide. </li>
    <li>Simply put, this social revolution is tantamount to the re-orientation of the whole nation and even the continent. This is a horrendous task as it will require the manner, scope, and level of spirited mass orientation that will reach the poorest of the poor, the most unlettered of the illiterate, the most remotely located of the rural, the oldest of the old, the youngest of the young, the most sophisticated of the rich, the most enlightened of the learned, and the entire body of the Nigerian people and indeed Africa. </li>  
     <li> The gains of a social revolution will not pour in immediately, and people are usually impatient to work and sacrifice for what they may not be alive to see the gains. </li> 
      <li>As with any socio-political mission, a campaign for change starts with a few early vanguards, whom will no doubt be subjected to all forms of ridicule, criticism, and even physical attacks. Not many can stand these.</li>
    </ul>
 
  <br/>
 The good news is that as many and daunting as these challenges may seem, they are surmountable. People will change when they are sufficiently convinced, and so it behooves of the vanguards of this revolution to be resilient and forbearing. The bandwagon effect is also there to our advantage in that once we can work hard enough to gain some degree and measure of popularity, people start falling in line because it is the vogue, and this is called the stage of sweeping momentum. The nature of a revolutionary message is that it meets stiff resistance{/* for a long time */}initially and then begins to record a very slow-paced and dwindling success. But, all of a sudden it hits its moment of popularity and gains the sweeping momentum. Those who start it may not be the ones to see it gain the sweeping momentum and ultimately the intended socio-political transformation in the country, but that is immaterial. What is of paramount concern is that we would have planted our names in the sands of history, and live forever in the memories of the future generation as their heroes and heroines. We would have lived a fulfilled life by leaving a lasting legacy and a great and prosperous nation for our future generation yet unborn.
